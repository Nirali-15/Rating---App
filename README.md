# Rating---App

->The Rating App is a full-stack web application where users can rate different stores and share their feedback.

->It has a secure login system so both customers and store owners can access their own dashboards. 

->Customers can easily give ratings from 1 to 5, while store owners can view their storeâ€™s average rating and see the list of users who rated them.

->The project is built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js/Express.js for the backend, and a database (MySQL) to store user and rating details.

->This app demonstrates how authentication, role-based access, and data management work together in a real-world full-stack project.
